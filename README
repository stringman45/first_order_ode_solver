This module contains various functions to solve first order ordinary
differential equations. For examples, see the docstring for the solve_ode
method.

To run the file use the following command in the SAGE shell.

sage: runfile 'exercises_elem_ode_solver.sage'

To run the file as a module, you need to preparse the module as a python file;
i.e., use the command in a linux shell (NOT in the SAGE shell):

$ sage --preparse exercises_elem_ode_solver.sage

This will create a file exercises_elem_ode_solver.py which can then be imported
as a module like in normal python. Then you are free to run the solve_ode
method.

Note that I have not included proper SAGE docstring formatting in this 
module-docstring because I have not found a way to actually see this docstring
in the SAGE command shell.
