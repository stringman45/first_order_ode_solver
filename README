This is a SAGE module that is to be used in the SAGE Computer Algebra System.
Upon my limited testing, I have found it can solve a few more first order
ODEs than SAGE's built-in. To you use it, you have to have SAGE installed.
To install SAGE, click download from this link: http://www.sagemath.org/

This module contains various functions to solve first order ordinary
differential equations. For examples, see the docstring for the solve_ode
method.

To run the file use the following command in the SAGE shell.

sage: runfile 'exercises_elem_ode_solver.sage'

To run the file as a module, you need to preparse the module as a python file;
i.e., use the command in a linux shell (NOT in the SAGE shell):

$ sage --preparse exercises_elem_ode_solver.sage

This will create a file exercises_elem_ode_solver.py which can then be imported
as a module like in normal python. Then you are free to run the solve_ode
method.
